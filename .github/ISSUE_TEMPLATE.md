Please stop and read this carefully. Otherwise your issue will be left **unaswered** and **closed**.

Issue tracker is _not_ a support forum, and if you have installation or usage problems, try asking your questions on [InsanelyMac.com](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/311293-applealc-—-dynamic-applehda-patching/) or [AppleLife.ru](https://applelife.ru/threads/applealc-dinamicheskij-patching-applehda.1171672/). There could also be local communities providing AppleALC support in your native language.

If you have not working sound, and you **cannot** offer new resources that fix the problem for you, you should go to the **support forums**. Here there are no people who create custom audio resources, or who deal with installation issues.

When to use issue tracker:
* You have new resources or patches to add but cannot make a pull request
* You have kernel panics, crashes, hangs
* You want to discuss technical or legal stuff

In most cases you need to provide the debug log, for that follow the instructions in [English](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Installation-and-usage) or [Russian](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Установка-и-использование).  
We have a guide on adding a new codec in [English](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Adding-codec-support) and [Russian](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Добавление-нового-кодека) as well.  
We have answers to most common questions in [English](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) and [Russian](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/wiki/Часто-задаваемые-вопросы).
